    <h1>How to Play</h1>

    <p>Tic Tac Toe is a fast, perfect-information game. You win by placing three of your marks (X or O) in a straight line before your opponent does.</p>

    <h2>Rules</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Players alternate turns placing exactly one mark in an empty square.</li>
      <li>Valid winning lines are any full row, column, or diagonal (8 total lines).</li>
      <li>The first player to complete a winning line wins immediately.</li>
      <li>If all 9 squares are filled with no winner, the game ends in a draw.</li>
      <li>There is no skipping turns and no overwriting an occupied square.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Quick Strategy Tips</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Start in the center</strong> when possible; it participates in 4 winning lines (the maximum).</li>
      <li><strong>Create forks</strong>: set up two simultaneous threats so the opponent can only block one.</li>
      <li><strong>Block immediately</strong> if the opponent is one move from winning—never ignore a threat.</li>
      <li><strong>Opposite corners</strong>: replying to a corner start with the opposite corner often prevents easy forks.</li>
      <li><strong>Force draws</strong>: when behind, prioritise blocking over creating low-probability threats.</li>
    </ul>
